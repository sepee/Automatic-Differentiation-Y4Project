suggestions:
    other applications
    benchmarking
    leave plenty of time for reprt/presentation
    be able to explain/teach AD

10 oct 2024:
    - do more literature review
        - specifically look at non-tree computational grpahs
        - specifically look at vector calc related to it
    - make automaic tree diagram of graph
        - animate this tree diagram to show steps of the algorithm

wednesday 16th oct 2024:
    - think about how to get audience to "think they understand"
        - use of graphics can help this a lot
        - for neural networks, they dont need to know the details, only that we are minimising the cost function of a "guesser" function. (try and make it guess better)
        - in new year FOCUS on presentation, refining, refining, refining

ideas:
    - Look at numerical optimization for finding maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimators in Bayesian statistics.
